# On_the_streets_of_Ottawa_Dashboard
This is an interactive dashboard that sheds light on the development of crime, homelessness and overdoses in the city of Ottawa from 2016 till 2023. Through comprehensive data analysis and user-friendly features, this tool provides valuable insights for policymakers and community leaders. I'm open to feedback to further enhance it.

Here you can see the main page of the dashboard, which includes an interactive map with the results of our clustering (k-means and dbscan) of the crime datasets. You can also select a specific type of crime to be displayed.

Here you can see the details of the map, where you will be able to appreciate our results of our clustering of the crime data in Ottawa using Kmenas and dbscan.

***This dashboard was made for the accompanying project On the streets of Ottawa by Emiliano Jimenez, Kevin Tawadros and Alexis Taillardat.***
